                <h3>Black Soil (Regur Soil)</h3>
                <p>
                    Black soil is rich in clay and has excellent moisture-retaining capacity.
                    It is highly fertile and suitable for crops like cotton, sugarcane, wheat,
                    and oilseeds. This soil type is commonly found in Maharashtra, Gujarat,
                    and Madhya Pradesh.
                    <br><br>
                    Black soil, also known as Regur soil or Black Cotton Soil, is one of the most important soil types in India. It is famous for its high moisture-retaining capacity and is especially suitable for cotton cultivation.

                <h3>Red Soil</h3>
                <p>
                    Red soil is formed due to weathering of igneous rocks and contains iron,
                    which gives it a red color. It is suitable for crops like millets, pulses,
                    groundnut, and cotton with proper irrigation.
                    <br><br>
                    Red soil is one of the major soil types found in India. It gets its red colour due to the presence of iron oxide. This soil is generally light-textured, porous, and suitable for crops with proper irrigation and fertilizers.

                <h3>Alluvial Soil</h3>
                <p>
                    Alluvial soil is highly fertile and found along river plains. It supports
                    crops such as rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, and vegetables. This soil is
                    common in northern and eastern parts of India.
                    <br><br>
                    Alluvial soil is the most widespread and agriculturally important soil in India. It is formed by the deposition of sediments brought by rivers, making it highly fertile and ideal for intensive farming.

                <h3>Laterite Soil</h3>
                <p>
                    Laterite soil is rich in iron and aluminum but poor in fertility. With
                    proper manure and irrigation, it can support crops like tea, coffee,
                    rubber, and cashew.
                    <br><br>
                    Laterite soil is a leached, acidic soil formed under high temperature and heavy rainfall conditions. The word laterite comes from the Latin word “later” meaning brick, as this soil hardens on exposure to air.
